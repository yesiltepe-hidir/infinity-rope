A cinematic scene from a classic western movie, featuring a rugged man riding a powerful horse through the vast Gobi Desert at sunset. The man, dressed in a dusty cowboy hat and a worn leather jacket, reins tightly on the horse's neck as he gallops across the golden sands. The sun sets dramatically behind them, casting long shadows and warm hues across the landscape. The background is filled with rolling dunes and sparse, rocky outcrops, emphasizing the harsh beauty of the desert. A dynamic wide shot from a low angle, capturing both the man and the expansive desert vista.
